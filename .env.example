# Example env for Formspree integration
# Option 1 (recommended): Full Formspree endpoint
# VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT="https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id_here"

# Option 2: Only the Form ID (will be converted to full URL by client)
# VITE_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID="your_form_id_here"

# Notes:
# 1) Create a free form at https://formspree.io/ and configure the destination email there.
#    During setup, set the recipient to: ocenmoses76@gmail.com
# 2) Copy the generated form ID or full endpoint above and create a local .env file
#    with the same keys (Vite requires the VITE_ prefix).
# 3) Restart the dev server after adding the .env file.
